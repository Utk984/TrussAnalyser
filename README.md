# Truss Analysis

This repository contains MATLAB code and report for analyzing 2D truss structures.

## Introduction

The code implements the direct stiffness method to analyze determinate trusses. It can calculate member forces and reactions for any planar truss geometry and loading.  

Key features:

- Handles any 2D truss geometry
- Calculates member tensions and compressions
- Calculates reactions at supports
- Plots input and result visualization

## Report

The full details of the theory, code implementation, and examples are documented in the [Report](Report.pdf) file

The report covers:

- Theory and working of the direct stiffness method
- Functions for geometry plotting, analysis, and results visualization
- Code documentation and sample usages
- Comparison with manual calculations

## Usage

See the report for code usage and examples. The [`main.m`](main.m) script provides sample code to call the functions.
